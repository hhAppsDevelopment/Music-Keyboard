# Music Keyboard
## The concept
This application is a virtual piano that aims to help students learning music theory. You can choose from a long list of instruments and even record/play your own plays!
## The project
This project is the final product of our mentoring efforts, created by a student in their last grade, just before graduating secondary school.
## Known issues
1. Some exceptions are not handled, application is easy to crash
2. Lacking revision on UI, not too user-friendly

## To try it out
As there is no executable file of any kind, you need to compile and run them yourself.
